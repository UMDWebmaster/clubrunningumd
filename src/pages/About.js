								Sohan is a senior computer science major and avid believer in the magical healing powers of E-Fields.
								When not running, Sohan spends his time thinking of ways to improve his Strava presence in hopes of
								pursuing a career as a Strava influencer. Some other things Sohan loves are fried tofu, the mind goblin,
								his dog Sophie, and studying up on Club Running and Brian Lau lore. Sohan is also a big fan of professional
								running and always looking to hear your hot takes and race predictions. Recently Sohan has been interested
								in making custom singlets (sometimes lacking in quality but always made with love), so talk to him if you
								have any great singlet ideas.

								an issue. As fundraising co-treasurer, Max is in charge of convincing as many other people as possible
								to give money to the club randomly so that you can go run meets!
